                  I'm a Front end Developer and curious about how I can develop
                  well-designed, and high-quality websites and applications. My
                  vision is to make a positive impact on my code and also share
                  my experience and support the ones who want to be developers
                  as much as I can. My educational background differs from my
                  current role since I want to create a career that consists of
                  design and tech together. That's why starting <b>Re: Coded</b>{" "}
                  has become a milestone for me. I'm continuing on this long
                  journey by taking sustainable steps.
