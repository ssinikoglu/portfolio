      <h2>Hi there Iâ€™m Sule Sinikoglu</h2>
      <p>I'm a Front end Developer and curious about how I can develop
      well-designed, and high-quality websites and applications. My vision is to
      make a positive impact on my code and also share my experience and support
      the ones who want to be developers as much as I can. My educational
      background differs from my current role since I want to create a career
      that consists of design and tech together. That's why starting RE: Coded
      has become a milestone for me. I'm continuing on this long journey by
      taking sustainable and confident steps.</p>
